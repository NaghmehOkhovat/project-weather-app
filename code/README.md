# Weather App

Project weather-app using fetch(),an APIJSON,Date()

## The problem

- Had some issues with displaying sunrise/sunset time in correct timezone. Used console.log() and stackoverflow to solve the issue.


- We had problem with changing the colors for each weather condition so we added style in JS document.body.style.color.

- If we had more time, we would have added more cities.
